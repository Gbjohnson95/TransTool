     * FIX HTML

     * Will fix HTML. Basically, you run a string as a parameter, and it opens
     * the selected file. It will go through and remove any problems.
     *
     * The assumption is, and I still haven't delved into the HTML cleaner just
     * yet, is that it will parse through the file, similar to
     *
     * Not bad work here, I'm impressed. I may work on this some.....
