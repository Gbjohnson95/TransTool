# I-Learn 3.0 Transition Tool

***

 _What is the goal of this project?_
> We want to automate certain tasks involved with course conversions in a short development time as to get these features in the hands of people who need it as fast as we can. 

### Current Features (v0.2.1)

***

Currently, the TransTool supports the following:

> - Loads an already unzipped Brainhoney Manifest file and parses through the information
> - Loads quizzes, attaches them to grade items (if applicable) and gives default settings to them.
> - Loads DropBoxes and attaches them to grade items (if applicable)
> - Loads Discussion Boards and attaches them to grade items (if applicable)
> - Loads Content pages, cleans HTML and attaches headers.  

For quiz items, the following question types are supported:

> - Multiple Choice Questions
> - Multi-Select Questions
> - Short Answer Questions
> - Long Answer Questions
> - Matching Questions

Content:

Currently, everything available is also loaded into content pages.  This means that modules (previously known as files in Brainhoney) and all respective content is attached to them.

As of version 0.2.1, links and course documents such as PDF's, Doc, etc. are not automatically linked to the content.

### Road Map

***

The following features are planned on in the future:

> - Better UI, switching from Swing to JavaFX
> - Linking to external websites and course documents in the Content page
> - Improving, optimizing and better commenting the code, as well as creating a more suitable JavaDocs
> - Zipping files properly, without having to manually zip them

### Feature Requests

The TransTool is currently being worked on, mostly by a single person (Mark Hall). During the creation of this tool, he tried to make it easy, with as few buttons as possible. However, he cannot always foresee every possible circumstance, so feedback is always appreciated
